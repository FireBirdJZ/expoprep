# Welcome to your Expo index ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-index`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-index).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the index

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   npx expo start --go
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the index in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out index development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **index** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **index-example** directory and create a blank **index** directory where you can start developing.
